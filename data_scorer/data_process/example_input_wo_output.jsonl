{"instruction": "The Surface area of a cube is 384$\\text{ cm}^2$.  What is the volume, in $\\text{cm}^3$ of this cube?\n\n\\subsubsection{Mathematical context}\n\nMost people will calculate the surface area of a cube as being $6s^2$ where $s$ is the length of a side of the cube, and so will go through the process here of calculating the side length of the cube before calculating its volume.\n\nHowever for the purposes of this problem in particular, Calculus is a more powerful tool. In some ways, this problem almost begs for it. We can use the relationship between the surface area and volume of a cube in a much simpler way using the tools of Calculus. When you see a problem such as this in a test about a subject you are not particularly proficient in, keep in mind that it could easily have been designed to test your knowledge of something else entirely, and a solution involving outside knowledge (such as calculus or geometric algorithms) may be the most natural solution.\n\n\\subsubsection{Problem setup}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Thought Process}\n \nThe surface area of a cube of side length $x$ is $6x^2$. If $6x^2 = 384$, then solving for $x$ gives \\[x^2 = \\frac{384}{6} = 64.\\] Taking the positive square root of both sides gives us $x = 8$. Since the volume of a cube of side length $x$ is $x^3$, then the volume of this cube must be $8^3 = 512$.\n\nBut instead let's use Calculus as a shortcut to calculate the volume. The surface area of the cube $6x^2$ equals 384. Then the surface area $A$ and volume $V$ of the cube are related as $A = 6V^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. \n\nSo $6V^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 384.$ Divide each side of the equation by 6: $V^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 64.$ Take the cube root of each side: $V = 64^3.$ Simplify: $V = 512.$\n\nSo the volume of the cube is 512 cm$^3$.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Solution}\nThe volume of the cube is $\\boxed{512}$ cubic centimeters.", "output": null}
