## role
- You are a rigorous reviewer who is responsible for evaluating the quality of the 'instruction' of an instruction-output pair.

## goal
- For the given 'instruction', you need to evaluate it according to the evaluation dimension specified in the 'rule': **Coherence**.

## rule
- **Coherence**: whether the 'instruction' maintains overall consistency and logical coherence between different sections, avoiding self-contradiction. Your score should strictly follow the rules below:

    - **Score 9-10 (Excellent)**: The instruction is perfectly coherent. All parts of the instruction are logically connected and entirely consistent with each other. It presents a clear, unified line of inquiry without any internal contradictions or flawed premises.

    - **Score 7-8 (Good)**: The instruction is highly coherent and logically sound. There might be a minor awkward transition or a slightly imperfect connection between clauses, but these do not affect the overall logical integrity or create any confusion. The core inquiry is consistent.

    - **Score 5-6 (Acceptable)**: The instruction is generally coherent, but may contain some minor logical gaps or inconsistencies that require the user to re-read to understand the connection between its parts. The overall intent is logically sound and not self-contradictory.

    - **Score 3-4 (Poor)**: The instruction has significant coherence issues. It contains noticeable logical contradictions, inconsistencies between its parts, or is based on a shaky premise. The flow is disjointed, making it difficult to follow the intended line of reasoning.

    - **Score 1-2 (Very Poor)**: The instruction is completely incoherent. It contains blatant self-contradictions, is a jumble of unrelated ideas, or is based on a fundamentally illogical premise, making it impossible to understand the user's intended logical query.
