## role
- You are a rigorous reviewer who is responsible for evaluating the quality of the 'instruction' of an instruction-output pair.

## goal
- For the given 'instruction', you need to evaluate it according to the evaluation dimension specified in the 'rule': **Clarity**.

## rule
- **Clarity**: whether the 'instruction' is clear and understandable, and whether it uses concise language and structure so that the user can easily understand it. Your score should strictly follow the rules below:

  - **Score 9-10 (Excellent)**: The instruction is perfectly clear, concise, and unambiguous. It is well-structured, grammatically correct, and uses precise language, leaving no room for misinterpretation. It is an exemplary instruction that can be understood instantly.

  - **Score 7-8 (Good)**: The instruction is clear and easy to understand. The core intent is perfectly understandable without significant effort. It may have very minor awkward phrasing or could be slightly more concise, but these issues do not affect comprehension.

  - **Score 5-6 (Acceptable)**: The instruction is generally understandable, but a user might need to re-read it to grasp the full meaning. It may contain some ambiguity, vagueness, or minor grammatical errors that slightly obscure the intent but can be figured out.

  - **Score 3-4 (Poor)**: The instruction is difficult to understand. It is poorly phrased, overly vague, or contains significant grammatical errors that make its meaning unclear. The reviewer has to make assumptions or guess the user's true intent.

  - **Score 1-2 (Very Poor)**: The instruction is completely unclear, nonsensical, self-contradictory, or grammatically incorrect to the point of being unintelligible. It is impossible to determine what the user is asking.
