Specifically, we can write:\n\\[3.333 = \\frac{3333}{1000},\\]\n\\[15.556 = \\frac{15556}{1000}.\\]\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{3333}{1000}}{\\frac{15556}{1000}} = \\frac{3333}{15556}.\\]\nThis fraction is already in its simplest form because 3333 and 15556 do not have any common factors other than 1.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\((3.333 \\times 10^{-7}) \\div (6.667 \\times 10^{-7} + 8.889 \\times 10^{-7})\\) in the form of a common fraction is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{3333}{15556}}.\\]", "id": 120, "Q_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Difficulty": null, "Deita_Complexity": null, "Thinking_Prob": null}, "QA_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Relevance": null, "IFD": null, "Deita_Quality": null, "Reward_Model": null, "A_Length": null, "Fail_Rate": null}}

Therefore, the number of small red marbles is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4}N = \\frac{1}{2}N \\), and the number of large red marbles is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4}N = \\frac{1}{4}N \\).\n\nThe total number of red marbles is \\( \\frac{3}{4}N \\), and the total number of green marbles is \\( \\frac{1}{4}N \\). The green marbles are divided into 4 groups, so each group has \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4}N = \\frac{1}{16}N \\) green marbles.\n\nSince the total number of marbles \\( N \\) must be a multiple of 16 (because \\( \\frac{1}{16}N \\) must be an integer), we need to find the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 50. The multiples of 16 less than 50 are 16, 32, and 48. The largest of these is 48.\n\nLet's verify that \\( N = 48 \\) works:\n- The number of red marbles is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 48 = 36 \\).\n- The number of green marbles is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 48 = 12 \\).\n- The number of small red marbles is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 = 18 \\).\n- The number of large red marbles is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9 \\).\n- Each group of green marbles contains \\( \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\) green marbles.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, so the greatest number of marbles you could have in less than 50 is \\( \\boxed{48} \\).", "id": 252, "Q_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Difficulty": null, "Deita_Complexity": null, "Thinking_Prob": null}, "QA_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Relevance": null, "IFD": null, "Deita_Quality": null, "Reward_Model": null, "A_Length": null, "Fail_Rate": null}}

Let \\(z = y - 1\\), then the equation becomes:\n\\[\n(2(z + 1) - 1)z^2 = 3\n\\]\nSimplify the left side:\n\\[\n(2z + 2 - 1)z^2 = 3 \\implies (2z + 1)z^2 = 3 \\implies 2z^3 + z^2 - 3 = 0\n\\]\nThis is a cubic equation in \\(z\\). To solve \\(2z^3 + z^2 - 3 = 0\\), we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the polynomial is a factor of the constant term (-3) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (2). The possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3}{2}\\). Testing these values, we find:\n\\[\n2(1)^3 + (1)^2 - 3 = 2 + 1 - 3 = 0\n\\]\nSo, \\(z = 1\\) is a root. Therefore, \\(y - 1 = 1\\) which gives \\(y = 2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the corresponding value of \\(x\\).\nUsing the expression \\(x = (y - 1)^2\\) and substituting \\(y = 2\\), we get:\n\\[\nx = (2 - 1)^2 = 1^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) back into the original equations:\n1. \\(y = \\sqrt{x} + 1 \\implies 2 = \\sqrt{1} + 1 \\implies 2 = 2\\) (True)\n2. \\(y = \\frac{x+3}{2x} \\implies 2 = \\frac{1+3}{2 \\cdot 1} \\implies 2 = \\frac{4}{2} \\implies 2 = 2\\) (True)\n\nSince both equations are satisfied, the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies both equations is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]", "id": 442, "Q_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Difficulty": null, "Deita_Complexity": null, "Thinking_Prob": null}, "QA_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Relevance": null, "IFD": null, "Deita_Quality": null, "Reward_Model": null, "A_Length": null, "Fail_Rate": null}}

The distances are 16, 23, 24, 45, 47, 68, 71, and 100.\n\nFirst, observe that if six points are collinear, then the distances between these points must satisfy the triangle inequality in a way that allows them to be arranged in a straight line. Specifically, if six points are collinear, the sum of the lengths of any two segments that do not share an endpoint must be greater than or equal to the length of the segment that is the sum of the other two segments.\n\nLet's assume that six of these points, say \\(A, B, C, D, E, F\\), are collinear.

He has 4 siblings and spent $2 on each sibling, so the total amount spent on lunch is $2 \\times 4 = $8.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money he spent on the third of the total amount he made. Since he spent $54 on his way to school, the amount he spent on the third of the total amount is $\\frac{54}{3} = $18.\n\nAdding up all the expenses, we get:\n- Amount spent on his way to school: $54\n- Amount spent on lunch: $8\n- Amount spent on the third of the total amount: $18\n- Therefore, the total amount spent is $54 + $8 + $18 = $80.\n\nSince the problem states that he has to leave absolutely no money in his wallet, the amount of money he has left is $\\boxed{0}$.", "id": 619, "Q_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Difficulty": null, "Deita_Complexity": null, "Thinking_Prob": null}, "QA_scores": {"Clarity": null, "Coherence": null, "Completeness": null, "Complexity": null, "Correctness": null, "Meaningfulness": null, "Relevance": null, "IFD": null, "Deita_Quality": null, "Reward_Model": null, "A_Length": null, "Fail_Rate": null}}

{"instruction": "The Surface area of a cube is 384$\\text{ cm}^2$.  What is the volume, in $\\text{cm}^3$ of this cube?\n\n\\subsubsection{Mathematical context}\n\nMost people will calculate the surface area of a cube as being $6s^2$ where $s$ is the length of a side of the cube, and so will go through the process here of calculating the side length of the cube before calculating its volume.\n\nHowever for the purposes of this problem in particular, Calculus is a more powerful tool. In some ways, this problem almost begs for it. We can use the relationship between the surface area and volume of a cube in a much simpler way using the tools of Calculus. When you see a problem such as this in a test about a subject you are not particularly proficient in, keep in mind that it could easily have been designed to test your knowledge of something else entirely, and a solution involving outside knowledge (such as calculus or geometric algorithms) may be the most natural solution.\n\n\\subsubsection{Problem setup}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Thought Process}\n \nThe surface area of a cube of side length $x$ is $6x^2$. If $6x^2 = 384$, then solving for $x$ gives \\[x^2 = \\frac{384}{6} = 64.\\] Taking the positive square root of both sides gives us $x = 8$. Since the volume of a cube of side length $x$ is $x^3$, then the volume of this cube must be $8^3 = 512$.\n\nBut instead let's use Calculus as a shortcut to calculate the volume. The surface area of the cube $6x^2$ equals 384. Then the surface area $A$ and volume $V$ of the cube are related as $A = 6V^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. \n\nSo $6V^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 384.$ Divide each side of the equation by 6: $V^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 64.$ Take the cube root of each side: $V = 64^3.$ Simplify: $V = 512.$\n\nSo the volume of the cube is 512 cm$^3$.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Solution}\nThe volume of the cube is $\\boxed{512}$ cubic centimeters.", "output": "To determine the volume of the cube given its surface area, we can use both the traditional algebraic approach and the calculus-based approach.
